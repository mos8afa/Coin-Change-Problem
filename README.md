# 🪙 Coin Change Problem – Algorithms Comparison

This repository presents a small **algorithm study** of the classic **Coin Change** problem, implemented in Python 🐍.

> **Problem statement:**  
> Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, determine the  
> **minimum number of coins** needed to make that amount.  
> If it is not possible to form the amount using the given coins, return `-1`.

The goal of this repo is to compare **two different approaches** to solving this problem:

- 🧪 **Naive recursive solution** – `algorithm1.py`  
- ⚙️ **Optimized dynamic-programming solution** – `algorithm2.py`  

The code is kept clean and minimal so that the focus stays on the **core idea of each algorithm**.
